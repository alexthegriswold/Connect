I've preloaded three users for the log in.

username: "alex@mobilepic.co"
password: "123456"
        
username: "9547896903"
password: "password"
        
username: "email@google.com"
password: "letmein"

You'll also be able to create an account and change the password for a user name if you forget it. 

Thanks for checking out the project!! :)
